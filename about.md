# Hello, I'm an IT enthusiast, problem solver, and tech whisperer.

While others talk to their computer, I listen to it and tell you what it really means!

When others see 'Error 404', I see an exciting challenge!

I transform computer language into human language, so that you too can understand what your computer is up to all day!

Professionally, I have worked in various technical fields. In doing so, I have repeatedly found that access to technical knowledge is often unnecessarily complicated. This is exactly what I want to change with this website.

With Rubin-Hood, I pursue the goal of making IT knowledge understandable and accessible so that everyone - whether beginner or professional - can benefit from it. I share my experiences, offer useful tips, and implement creative projects that show that technology can be not only complex but also exciting and accessible.

In my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies, develop my skills further, and am always looking for new challenges that help me and others progress.

I look forward to sharing this journey with you and am excited to see where it takes us!
